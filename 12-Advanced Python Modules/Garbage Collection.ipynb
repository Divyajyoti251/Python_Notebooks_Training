Because the object’s reference counter could never reach 0 (due to cycle), a reference counter cannot destroy the object. Therefore, in situations like this, we employ the universal waste collector. It operates and releases the memory used. A Generational Garbage Collector can be found in the standard library’s gc module.\n",

Python schedules garbage collection based upon a threshold of object allocations and object deallocations. When the number of allocations minus the number of deallocations is greater than the threshold number, the garbage collector is run. One can inspect the threshold for new objects (objects in Python known as generation 0 objects) by importing the gc module and asking for garbage collection thresholds"

    "Automated memory management: To avoid memory leaks and lower the chance of running out of memory, the Python garbage collector automatically removes objects that are no longer referenced.\n",
    "Memory management made easier: The garbage collector frees developers from having to manually manage memory so they can concentrate on creating code, making Python a higher-level and more practical language for developers.\n",
    "Efficient memory cleanup: The garbage collector is designed to minimise performance effects while swiftly identifying and collecting short-lived objects via generational garbage collection.\n",
    "Customizable settings: The garbage collector provides options to customize its settings, such as adjusting the thresholds for different generations, allowing developers to fine-tune the garbage collection process based on their specific application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages :\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on performance: Although the garbage collector is designed to efficiently clean up unused memory, there may still be some CPU consumption and execution time overhead, particularly when working with a large number of objects.\n",
    "The difficulty of memory management: Although Python’s garbage collector makes managing memory easier, using it successfully may still necessitate knowledge of concepts like object lifetimes, object references, and garbage collection algorithms.\n",
    "Limited control over memory management: The autonomous nature of the garbage collector leaves developers with little control over the precise timing and behaviour of memory cleanup, which may not be ideal for many application scenarios where fine-grained control over memory management is necessary.\n",
    "Bug potential: Although the garbage collector is intended to be dependable and effective, it is not impervious to errors or atypical behaviour, which could lead to memory leaks or improper object cleanup.\n"
