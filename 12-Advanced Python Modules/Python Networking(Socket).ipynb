    "Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has libraries that provide higher-level access to specific application-level network protocols, such as FTP, HTTP, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter gives you understanding on most famous concept in Networking - Socket Programming.\n",

    "What is Sockets?\n",
    "Sockets are the endpoints of a bidirectional communications channel. Sockets may communicate within a process, between processes on the same machine, or between processes on different continents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sockets may be implemented over a number of different channel types: Unix domain sockets, TCP, UDP, and so on. The socket library provides specific classes for handling the common transports as well as a generic interface for handling the rest.\n",

    "Sockets have their own vocabulary −"
